            <center>The Three-Sword Style (Santoryu) is a unique and iconic sword-fighting technique used by Roronoa Zoro, one of the main characters in One Piece. Created by Eiichiro Oda, this fictional combat style sets Zoro apart from traditional swordsmen by having him wield three katanas—two in his hands and one in his mouth.
            Zoro developed the Three-Sword Style as part of his vow to become the world’s greatest swordsman. The addition of the sword in his mouth gives him an unorthodox edge, allowing him to unleash powerful and devastating attacks. Some of his signature moves include the Oni Giri (Demon Slash), where he charges at his enemy with all three swords, and the Sanzen Sekai (Three Thousand Worlds), a move he uses in major battles.
            Throughout his journey, Zoro’s style evolves, especially as he learns to incorporate Haki, a supernatural ability that enhances his strength. His dedication to mastering the Three-Sword Style is a symbol of his unwavering determination, making him one of the most feared and respected fighters in the world of One Piece.
           The Three-Sword Style not only highlights Zoro’s combat prowess but also embodies his relentless spirit and loyalty to his promise to a childhood friend, Kuina, adding emotional depth to his character’s journey.</h1>
